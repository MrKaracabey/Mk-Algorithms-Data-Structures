## Data Structures

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.
Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.
Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

`B` - Beginner, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Recursion](src/data-structures/recursion)


<hr>

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

`B` - Beginner, `A` - Advanced

### Algorithms by Topic

* `B` [It Will be Uptade](src/algorithms/math/bits) - it will be update


### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.

* `B` [It Will be Uptade](src/algorithms/math/bits) - it will be update

## Problems

* **Promlems Repo :)**
    * `B` [It Will be Uptade](src/algorithms/math/bits) - it will be update

golang-algorithms-dataStructures is a personal open source project that I have put thousands of hours into perfecting with the
goal of making it the very best source  for **magnificient** golang. I need your help to achieve this.

Donating  helps
motivate me to continue working on the project.
